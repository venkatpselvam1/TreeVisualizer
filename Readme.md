## Introduction
    Most of the time, we have some json structure which we want to visualize. visualize will us get more insights and better explanatory. It will helps us to explain our thoughts to the audience when we present it.

## Json-Visualizer
    Json is most used format to represent the data. when we say visualize, we mean that, we want to see the parent-child relation ship of the given json data. 

## Idea
    In any parent-child scenario, there will be two types of data in json. 
        1. Attribute about the parent 
        2. Attribute about the child - reference (and recursively we explore the children)

## what are the inputs
    Mandatory inputs:
        1. Json data - which we want to visualize
        2. Parent Attributes names - which we want to see
        3. Child attribute names - to recursively build the tree
